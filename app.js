// ## 1. Verbal questions

// 1. Parameters are the variables defined when declaring a function, like placeholders. Arguments are the actual values passed into a function when calling it.
// 2. Return actually outputs a result wherever the function is called that can then be used further, while console.log just prints the output to the console/terminal.
// 3. A value returned by a function can be used and reused within and throughout your code wherever you would use any value, instead of e.g. only sending a message to the console.
